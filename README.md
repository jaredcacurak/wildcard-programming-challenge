Wildcard Programming Challenge
--------------------------
At Wildcard we're big fans of hack days, tech talks, and puzzles, so we thought it would be fun to build a programming challenge of our very own.

The challenge consists of two easy-to-medium difficulty programming problems. They can be completed using any language, and shouldn't take more than an hour or two. We recently ran a contest around the challenge, where we gave away some of the following fun prizes, but for now the only prize is glory. Good luck!
